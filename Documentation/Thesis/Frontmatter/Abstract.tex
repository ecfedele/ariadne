    Among all propulsive technologies, the design of modern, liquid-fueled rocket engines stands on its own as possibly the most arduous. Under simultaneous and competing pressures of maximum performance and minimum mass and cost, the design of even small rocket engines is an undertaking previously available to well-equipped nation-states and highly-capitalized government contractors. Even with a newfound democratization in space industry, the process of designing aerospace engines remains an extremely intensive workload. It is for this purpose that the \textit{Ariadne} application was conceived --- by building much of the rocket engine preliminary design functionality within the application logic, the designer is now free to consider many other aspects of the problem space. Using sophisticated deep learning models for combustion thermodynamics prediction, \textit{Ariadne} is capable of assisting the designer in initial design planning, thrust chamber geometry layout, heat transfer and power cycle design, and overall performance estimation across the entire rocket engine operating envelope.
